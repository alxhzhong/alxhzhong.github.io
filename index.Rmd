## Bio

Hello and welcome to my website! 

I am a first year [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) ScM student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My research interests include causal inference, clinical trials, and environmental/spatial statistics, though I am interested in exploring new areas in biostatistics!

In my free time, I enjoy baking, solving [contest crosswords](https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/crosswordcontestguide.pdf), and catching up on the latest [podcast](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/headlines/public-health-on-call-podcast) episode.
